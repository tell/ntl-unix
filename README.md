# NTL: A Library for doing Number Theory

This is a Git repository of a mirror of [NTL](http://www.shoup.net/ntl/) and several scripts.

# Design

- We follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) to make version numbers as much as possible.
    - An original version number `5.1a` is replaced by `v5.1-a` to follow it.
