FIXME: maybe it would make more sense to take the +1/-1 logic
out of [cg]_lip_impl block_construct routines and just put it in
the caller: the ZZ_p and ZZVec BlockConstruct stuff: add 1 there...
that would mean in the ZZ_p ConstructFromVec we don't do the -1 either...
not critical...

FIXME: maybe add a reserve method to Vec, for compatibility
with STL vectors.


TODO list:
     * speed up ZZX mul: faster HomMul and faster SSMul
     * speed up GF2X mul using new x86 instructions
     * Allow 60-bit primes by using long double's
     * allow 32-bit SP MulMod...this would allow GPU/SSE 
       support...both this and previous would require
       a complete scan to introduce new, special types
     * add template functions clear(), to clear multiple
       entries in a Vec or Poly.  The important thing is
       to provide specialized ones for Vec<GF2> and GF2X.



-----------------------------
These are basically notes to myself on preparing a new
distribution of NTL.
-----------------------------


- change version numbers in ../include/NTL/version.h, DIRNAME, and WINDIR

- change the libtool soname in VERSION_INFO. See:

http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html

- if changes were made to makefile or ../include/NTL/config.h, 
  make sure these changes are implemented in the template files 
  mfile and cfile, and then run:

./configure
cp makefile def_makefile
cp ../include/NTL/config.h ../include/NTL/def_config.h

- update ../README and ../doc/copying.txt

- run:  

make ppdoc
make ppclean
make package
make winpack

NOTE: try executing export COPYFILE_DISABLE=1
beforehand
